# hw repos

This is important...

NO PERSONAL REPOS FOR ASSIGNMENTS!

Homework assignments are meant to be individual assignments, not group assignments. And their repos need to be private and part of the ds5110 organization, not your personal github accounts! Github Classroom automatically creates these repos for you.

To work on a homework assignment, follow the instructions in Canvas and click on the link in Canvas. Clicking the link should cause github classroom to create a private repository for you. That repo should be associated with your Northeastern credentials and should be part of the ds5110 github organization.

If this doesn't happen for some reason, then let me know ASAP.  It is possible that your credentials for the class need to be fixed.

If you have inadvertently created a repo outside of the ds5110 github organization for any assignment in this class (including projects), then please delete it ASAP. Repos for homework assignments should be part of the ds5110 organization and should remain private forever.

Regarding project repos: These are the only exception to the policy about assignments. As you will see, I add team members as collaborators to github-classroom project repos created by team leads. After you have completed your project, and with your stakeholder's permission, my hope is that your project will be made public so that it can be part of your portfolio to help you find a job.
